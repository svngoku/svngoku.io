                <p> 
                    Passionate by computer science, I started with the object oriented programming (<b>C#</b> and <b>C</b>), working on a <b>Linux environment</b> and Databases systems (<b>SQL</b> and <b>NoSQL</b>), that introduced me on the basic understanding of computer science and is world.
                    <br />
                    My passion became more and more consequent, I decided to learn web and mobile development by myself on <b>Youtube</b>, by reading programming books and articles on the web in addition to my academics 
                    courses as a <b>Junior full stack developer</b> and <b>IT Project Manager</b>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Now, I do Data science as <b>Big Data Engineer</b>
                    <br />
                    This allows me to become an expert in data analysis and data treatment, able to solve complex problems with deep learning techniques, machine learning, data engineering 
                    (<b>ETL, DataLake, Data Warehousing</b>) and data visualization.
                    With the goal to reveal the true value of data by processing, analyzing and modeling it and then interpreting the result(s).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After 6 years in this binary and incredibly evolving world, I consider myself a multilingual computer programmer and a technology entrepreneur.
